**Innovative AR Marketplace: Transforming Furniture Shopping**

For my final work project, I embarked on an exciting journey to create a groundbreaking marketplace application that revolutionizes how people buy and sell furniture. This platform allows users to effortlessly showcase their furniture through visually captivating posts, transforming traditional shopping into an interactive experience.

The standout feature of this application is its augmented reality (AR) functionality, which empowers users to visualize furniture in their own living spaces directly from their smartphones. Imagine browsing through a wide array of stunning furniture options and instantly placing them in your room to see how they fitâ€”this is the future of shopping!

Through this project, I learned invaluable lessons about the importance of choosing the right technology stack. While cross-platform solutions like Expo are convenient, they can sometimes limit creative possibilities. This experience has reinforced my commitment to leveraging the most suitable tools to bring innovative ideas to life.

Join me in exploring this dynamic marketplace where technology meets creativity, making furniture shopping not just a task, but an inspiring adventure!
